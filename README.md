### Hey people from earth! ðŸ‘‹

Meet the PHP Party Planner, turning boring code into a poetry! I wear a hat because it's cool, and I speak in PHP and JavaScript, the language of web wizards. I make web apps that dance and sing â€“ and sometimes, they even tell jokes!

#### Skiils I have

- Speak in PHP and JavaScript, like talking to computers but with a sprinkle of fun.
- Create web apps super-fast, like making a sandwich but without the mess.
- Fix tricky code problems, like finding lost toys in a big toy box.
- Expert on API and Integration that it feels like waving a magic wand.
- Comfortable with NodeJS, ReactJS and VueJS pretending those are rocket science, aparently not!
- Fix tricky problems in the code, like finding a needle in a haystack but way more fun.
- Master of the ancient art of debugging, with the patience of a saint and the determination of a caffeine-fueled ninja.

#### Cool Stuff I Can Do

- Juggle lots of things at once, like spinning plates but with computer tasks.
- Make websites work on any gadget â€“ phones, computers, tabs, ohh - you name it!
- Understand old code like it's a storybook adventure.
