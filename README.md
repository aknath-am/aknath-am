### Hey Earthlings! 👽

I'm your friendly neighborhood PHP Party Planner, turning boring old code into digital disco! 🕺💻

Yes, I wear a hat. No, it doesn’t improve my code – but it does make me 73% cooler. I speak PHP and JavaScript fluently – basically web wizardry with a touch of sarcasm. I build web apps that dance, sing, and occasionally throw sarcastic error messages.

#### 🧠 Skills? Oh, I got 'em:

- Fluent in PHP and JavaScript – it’s like talking to robots, but they never text back.
- Build web apps faster than you can say "Did you clear your cache?"
- Solve bugs like a digital Sherlock Holmes – pipe and magnifying glass included.
- API whisperer. I talk to services like they’re old friends at a pub.
- Know my way around NodeJS, ReactJS, VueJS – basically anything ending in "JS" or sounding mildly intimidating.
- Debugging pro: Like finding a typo in a sea of spaghetti. Blindfolded. On a rollercoaster.
- Can refactor your messy code without crying (most of the time).

#### 🤹‍♂️ Cool Tricks I Do:

- Juggle tasks like a caffeinated circus act – no dropped balls (just semicolons).
- Make websites look beautiful on anything: phones, tablets, toasters, your grandma’s fridge.
- Read legacy code like a bedtime story – and sometimes cry afterward.
- Certified expert in "turning coffee into code since dinosaurs roamed the earth."
- Level 99 in Stack Overflow lurking.
